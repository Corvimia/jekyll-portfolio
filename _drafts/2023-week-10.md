- Not a great start to the week, having a depressive episode.
- J-- came over on Tuesday and we had a nice night in, we started watching *Handmaiden's Tale* which is an interesting modern dystopian show.
- Spent the day in bed on Wednesday, peak depression - didn't want to do anything. Still managed to join a couple of meetings but I barely participated in them.
- Snow has come to us! I love the snow, and I'm sad it's already gone. If only we could have LARPed in it on Sunday, that would have been amazing!
- Managed to get myself in gear, and managed to do some crafting projects with Ri--. I ended up spray painting my emblem on the replacement arrow heads, gluing a few of them, an generally repairing some arrows. I also made a little soft leather sheath for me boot knife, and I'm hoping I can use it on Sunday. 
- Started watching Owl House, which is a fun little cartoon.
- Resolved an issue at work where Ansible kept dropping the connection when connecting to our EC2 instances. SSH worked, and after a few tries it turned out that SCP was the cause. OpenSSH updated with the MacOS Ventura update, and SCP apparently now uses SFTP instead of SSH by default.
- ??? I need to make a stake holder for the giant stake I bought at LarpCon, as we're likely
