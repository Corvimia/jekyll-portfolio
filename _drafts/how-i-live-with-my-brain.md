- Not being believed
- Having a hard time explaining it
- Pottery analogy? Fog?
- Thoughts that I put down are not picked up
- Not... *wanting* to talk about things, making it hard to seek help
- Struggle *wanting* to do anything, no want difference from wanting nothing
- Aphantasia
- Memory problems
- no thoughts head empty
