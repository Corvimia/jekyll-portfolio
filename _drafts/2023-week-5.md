- Start of this week was pretty chill. Unfortunately my monday RPG cancelled so I was left to my own device, but one of my friend group decided to raid the discord voicechat, so I ended up staying with them all evening, and playing some *Vampire Survivor* again, which I hadn't picked up in over 6 months.
