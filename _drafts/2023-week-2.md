- Been having fun with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), rewriting some of our test suite to follow their [Page Object Model](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom) pattern.
- Had a really productive meeting with some people outside my team, but I got told off for not including my team lead in it. ðŸ¤£
- First crafting evening of the year!
