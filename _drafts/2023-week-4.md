- The start of this week was quite high in emotions, as I got 2 interviews in the first 2 days, and they went relatively ok, I think.
- In Elden ring, I also managed to beat Raya Lucaria Academy, and Renalla. This final fight was really cool and had a great atmosphere. I'm a bit sad I beat it first time and didn't get to experience it more. Maybe I'll do another run! 
- Tuesday night was spent fighting my laptop & Octoprint again! At least I'm learning a bit about serial ports and Ubuntu ðŸ˜‚
- Agreed with J-- that we'd spend the 18th together, so I've been looking at various activities for the day!
