- I quit my job this week. My manager is taking it relatively well.
- I've been idly thinking about picking up Unity again, which I might do soon.
- I finally received my anti androgen, after nearly a week and a half without!
- Had a really good chat with J-- about mental health, neurodivergence, and my need for proper counselling. She even convinced me to use a self referall service to make some headway.
