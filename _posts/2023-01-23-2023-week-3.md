- Had an excellent chat with R-- about going out, and shopping, and communicating better with J--.
- Over the week, did a few interview, which went well. I need to spend a bit more time on prepping for STAR style questions if those jobs don't come through.
- On the Saturday, J-- came over to do some crafting, but I realised after a few hours that I was having a bad time - no energy to really do anything, no motivation, etc.
After debating with J--, and my brain, I set myself the simple task of going to the shop to buy some fresh veggies to make a stir fry, which massively helped.
I can't quite tell if it was the walk to the shop, the shopping, or a combination of the 2, but afterward I felt very energised for the rest of the night.
- Sunday was another LARP day! It was quite a good day for Faroth. I ended up with quite a few threads to follow in the next games, as well as a bonus payment for helping an NPC find redemption and closure.
- The car is finally on its way! it's booked to arrive on the 30th. I'm quite excited to be driving a nearly new car (only 4 years old!) instead of some 15-20yo car without bluetooth ðŸ¤£
- Got my prescription reviewed and we're increasing both Spironolactone (from 50mg to 100mg) and Estradiol (from 5mg to 6mg), which is exciting!
