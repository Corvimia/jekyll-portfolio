- Start of this week was pretty chill. Unfortunately my monday RPG cancelled so I was left to my own device, but one of my friend group decided to raid the discord voicechat, so I ended up staying with them all evening, and playing some *Vampire Survivor* again, which I hadn't picked up in over 6 months.
- I spent a lot of time talking to LL's recruiter, as I was interested in their offer, but I was also interested in GS, which had the last interview happening on the friday.
Researching GS in depth made me realise how cool their products & company was, and how much I wanted to work for them, so I had a lot of hopes for the last interview. In the end, the interview was mostly me asking loads of questions about the company, and their CTO answering them, and us having a chat about the product and the company in general.
- They made an offer on Friday night!! I was so excited when I received the call. I can't wait to start working for them!!
- The weekend was spent in Gloucester, volunteering at the Empire stall, chatting with newcomers and existing players about the game. It was a lot of fun!
- Spent a decent amount of time with some volunteer from Fantasy Forest, and I am quite excited to go volunteering for them in July.
