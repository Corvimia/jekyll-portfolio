This past year has seen a lot of changes for me, on very many levels.

## Trans stuff
#### Moved to new meds
When I started HRT, I was put on Finasteride & Oestrogen.
As I've learned after nearly a year on Gel, is that it doesn't really mesh with how I function.
Using it at LARP was quite difficult, as showers are often optional, and mixing the alcoholic gel with sweat isn't the most pleasant feeling (and probably doesn't work very well, who knows)
And it turned out that Finasteride wasn't quite working for me, as it's quite a weak anti-androgen, from what I gathered.

So now I'm on Spironolactone, Estradiol and Utrogestan.
The pills have made it so much easier to take regularly (including at LARP), but I still struggle with the fact that I need to take Spiro with a meal, and Utrogestan outside of one.
I'm doing my best, but it's still difficult to get that right, as I don't tend to eat in the morning.

#### Finding out my style
Fashion has never really been my jam, and after spending 30 years caring very little, it's difficult to know what to buy, where to buy, and how to buy.
Thanks to J--, her time and her support, I've been able to start getting a hand on what I like and don't like wearing.
It's a long process, but I'm slowly getting there.

#### Make up
It's quite hard to get into make up, I'll be honest. There's so many things to learn, techniques to master, products to buy.
And if I don't have everything looking well, I feel like shit and just remove it before leaving the flat.
But thanks to R--'s advice, I've gotten a bit more confident with my eyeliner game, so I'm slowly building up from there, rather than trying to get everything right from the start.

#### Coming out
At the end of 2021, I had done my coming out with most of my social circles.
After a luke-warm response from my boss in early 2022, I had decided that I'd change job without coming out to my workplace.
But after a failure to get 2 jobs I was interested in, and the support from my new team lead, I decided to come out at work.
It went pretty well, and I don't regret it, although some people might ask why I did that just before leaving the company once I find a new job.
And thanks to J--'s push, I also came out to my family and the rest of my social circles, which means I'm fully out now! That's pretty good ✨

## Professional things

I've started following a few people from the industry, and reading what they have to say on a non-technical level.
After R-- left the company, I found myself having to work without an amazing developer who elevates me and challenges me to find better solutions to our problems.
Between her prodding and the few blogs I had been reading, I started to realise that I was not happy in my current job.
Although I'm in a decent position, I find very little of what we do challenging, and I find my colleague very average.

At the same time, a friend started working at Monzo in customer complaints, and told me a lot about their inner working and their philosophy.
I fell in love with their values, and as a long time user of Monzo, I was very excited to apply for their job.
Unfortunately, the lack of deadline on their website, as well as a summer season full of LARP means that I ended up missing the job opening, as they closed it down in October.

That kicked me in the ass, and allowed me to start updating my CV seriously. I even created a LinkedIn page, and registered to a couple of tech job websites.
As I'm a pretty comfortable position, I was pretty strict with the job I would apply for, which means I ended up only going through the 2 interview processes, and got no offer so far.

## Personal bits and bobs
#### Mental Health
I started Counselling for the first time this year, and I started dating J-- at the same time, and both of those did wonder for my mental health.
I wouldn't say I feel _better_, but I understand my own brain a fair amount more.
I'm not quite there yet, and have a lot of work to do, but it feels good to have started this process.

#### Dating
After ending my relationship in January 2022 (on good terms), I was pretty certain I was doing very well on my own, and didn't need any more relationships for a while.
Monogamous relationships were _too much_ for me. Too much time investment, too many daily messages, too strong an emotional investment.
And polyam relationship clearly needed _more_ of all of this, since they were with multiple people, right?

So after making those decisions, the LARP season started, and I met the amazing J--, while we were both crewing at the same event.
A week later of J--'s aggressive friendship making, and a little alcohol at the next LARP, resulted in a kiss and a shared tent.
Not long after we started dating, and it became my first polyam relationship, as she has a partner too!
It's been a massive learning experience to learn to communicate, but it's been excellent!

#### Holidays...?
I haven't really been on holiday since I stopped going with my parents, because I thought holidays were a lot of planning, and I didn't really have the energy for that.

Over the summer, we went camping to Wales with J-- for a few days, and it was a blast!
Her preparedness with all that is camping was definitely needed, but even the Welsh rain didn't make me think holidays were not worth it!

Turns out, you can just go somewhere and find a camping site to pitch a tent, and just vibe with the surrounding, visiting castles, going into old mines, and swimming in the sea!

#### Funding LARP
This year is a big year for LARP, as the most successful LARP in the UK has started gathering funding for getting a permanent site together.

And turns out, I want to be a part of that. Elevating the hobby with permanent structures, as well as allowing more people to access said hobby would be fantastic.
I've put a fair chunk of money in to support Unknown Worlds, and I hope it goes well in the years to come!

#### Career > House
When Unknown Worlds came around and ask for funding, I was trying to save money to buy a house.
Let's just say I wasn't doing a very good job of it, although I had accumulated near enough over the years.
After some unfruitful effort to find a place I liked for a price I liked, I started thinking that maybe I needed a better salary to afford a home I would like as a single woman.

Between Unknown Worlds and the fact that I learned to save better (saving accounts, LISA, etc), I slowly came to the decision that I wasn't going to buy a house yet.
I decided instead to focus on my career a little more, so that I would be able to save more, and afford a larger mortgage when the time comes.


#### More retrospection
As you can see, this year is full of retrospection!

This is the first time I've done this, and I plan to continue ✨



## Conclusion

I have a lot of momentum, and [a lot of ideas for 2023]({% post_url 2023-01-03-2023-preview %}), and I'm looking forward to be continuing on this path!
