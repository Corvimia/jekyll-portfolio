- Started the week at speed, by trying (and failing) to get some 3D print going first thing in the morning. Unfortunately my laptop seems to have some connection issues. It's quite frustrating!
- Doctor called about my foot warts and basically told me there's nothing they can do, and I should just wait it out. I wish the pharmacist would have told me that.
- Had my first appointment at a new laser hair removal clinic, and the clinician was really nice and welcoming. I felt really safe there, so I'm going back in a couple of week to start my full body treatment!
- I went to LARPcon to volunteer for the Empire stall. It was good fun, and it's really nice to be appreciated. Apocaplyse Prop makes so banging squishy bones and I'm definitely gonna spend some money their way soon.
