- Started the year well, by starting to write a few articles for this website, and getting a few of my chores done!
- Emailed a couple of recruiters to kick off my job search
- Rearranged some kitchen shelves, hoping to reduce friction and hoping to clear out the dishwasher more often.
- Started working on a personal Wiki for FnH (I set it up on my home laptop-as-server before the holidays)
- Had a long chat about PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance) with J--, I need to do some more research and potentially add it to the list of things to talk about for an official diagnostic
- Went to see Till, a very good movie about Emmet Till, a black boy who was lynched in the 50s.
Unfortunately the pacing of it just doesn't agree with my brain. Although I understand why it was paced that way, and I can appreciate it, I just got really bored during the movie. ðŸ˜‚
- It was my first week as a veggie, and it has been *interesting*. The Markeaton (post FnH derby pub) was an utter disappointment. Claiming that fries didn't come with the vegan burger because they could ensure the fries to be vegan, even though the burger is in the same price range as the rest!
- Had some success with my current practice of setting a few daily goal with my Accountability Buddy and getting them done.

Overall a pretty good week! âœ¨
