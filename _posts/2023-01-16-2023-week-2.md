- Been having fun with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), rewriting some of our test suite to follow their [Page Object Model](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom) pattern.
- Had a really productive meeting with some people outside my team, but I got told off for not including my team lead in it. ðŸ¤£
- First crafting evening of the year! Got my laptop setup with Octoprint to monitor my 3d printer, and start 3d prints from my main PC!
- Sent a form over to my GP for some of my foot problems
- Had 2 interviews! They went alright, I think. Although I'm still waiting to hear from one of them...
- Returned a top I bought the previous week. First time I returned a package, so I struggled knowing what to do, but J-- helped!
- Less success with my daily goals because I didn't set some every day, but I still managed to get things done more or less every day, so this is working!
- Went to the Red Brick Market in Birmingham with some friends. I got a new necklace, but it was otherwise fairly underwhelming.
- Talked some more with J-- about PDA, and how it fits in my life. It's amazing how many things are clicking into place
- Still struggling to focus at work, but it's getting a little better this week.
- Ordered & set up a new desk! I'm re-arranging my living room to be a better living space and this was the first step for me.
