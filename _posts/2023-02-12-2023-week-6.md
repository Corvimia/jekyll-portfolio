This post was definitely posted on Monday, and not on Friday ðŸ˜‚

- I quit my job this week. My manager is taking it relatively well.
- I've been idly thinking about picking up Unity again, which I might do soon.
- I finally received my anti androgen, after nearly a week and a half without!
- Had a really good chat with J-- about mental health, neurodivergence, and my need for proper counselling. She even convinced me to use a self referall service to make some headway.
- Wednesday Night was spent casting my and Ri--'s faces into plaster! it was quite a fun process but damn did we make a mess. Unfortunately we messed up mixing the plaster for him so he will need to do it again. Mine is drying on the side till next week.
- Had a skirmish social event with the Empire Skirmish Team. It was a lot of fun, and met an ex-skirmish team who came back. She's a trans woman who's further along her journey, and it's been really good talking to her!
